# ASCII-only transliteration of OP cuneiform #

## Individual signs
The following table lists a unique, case-sensitive transliteration for each phonetic and logographic  sign in the OP syllabary. The syllabic signs mimic the Unicode character name.  The logographic signs adopt the shorthand used by Skjærvø, *Introduction to Old Persian*.   Numeric values are are written with the corresponding Arabic numeral:  this is not a true transliteration, since a value like "10" is written with two numeric characters to represent the single OP sign.

In addition to the ASCII-only transcription, the OP transcoder allows alternative Unicode transliterations for `ssa`, `tha` and `XS`. 

Unicode does not include a character for the variant form of the `a` vowel that Skjærvø transliterates with `ă`.
